### Project: Simple Password Generator and Validator

In today's digital world, creating and managing strong passwords is essential for maintaining security. In this project, you will develop a simple password generator and validator using fundamental Python programming concepts. The goal is to create a program that generates a password based on user input and validates it according to specific criteria.

#### Requirements:

1. **Input Collection:**
   - Your program should prompt the user to enter their name and a favorite number. These inputs will be stored in variables.

2. **Password Generation:**
   - The password should be created by manipulating the user's name and favorite number.
   - Reverse the user's name, convert it to lowercase, and concatenate it with the favorite number.
   - Add a special character (e.g., "!") to the end of the password.

3. **Validation:**
   - Ensure the generated password is at least 8 characters long. If it is not, extend the password by appending random digits until it meets the length requirement.

4. **Output:**
   - Print each character of the password on a new line.
   - Allow the user to generate another password by asking if they want to continue. The program should repeat until the user chooses to stop.

5. **Constraints:**
   - Use basic programming constructs: variables, control structures (`if` statements, `for` and `while` loops), string manipulation, and built-in functions.
   - Do not define custom functions or classes.


#### Deliverables:
- A Python script that implements the password generator and validator according to the specifications.
- Demonstration of the program's functionality with at least two different user inputs.

#### Hints:

1. **Variables:**
   - Start by asking the user for their name and a favorite number. Store these in variables.

2. **String Manipulation:**
   - Combine the name and favorite number into a single string to form the base of the password.
   - Convert the name to lowercase and the favorite number to a string.
   - Reverse the name, and concatenate it with the favorite number to create a password base.
   - Add a special character (e.g., "!") to the end of the password base.

3. **Control Structures:**
   - Use an `if` statement to check if the password length is at least 8 characters. If not, add a random digit (between 1 and 9) repeatedly until the password length is 8 or more characters.
   - Use a `for` loop to print each character of the password on a new line.
   - Use a `while` loop to ask the user if they want to generate another password. The loop should continue until the user says "no."

4. **Functions and Constructors:**
   - Demonstrate the use of the `int()` constructor by converting the favorite number (which is initially a string) back to an integer for any arithmetic operations if needed.
   - Utilize built-in functions like `len()`, `str()`, and `input()` in the program.

#### Example Code:

```python
# Step 1: Variables
name = input("Enter your name: ")
fav_number = input("Enter your favorite number: ")

# Step 2: String Manipulation
password_base = name[::-1].lower() + fav_number + "!"
print(f"Password base: {password_base}")

# Step 3: Control Structures
if len(password_base) < 8:
    while len(password_base) < 8:
        password_base += str(int(fav_number) % 9 + 1)  # Adding a random digit to make it 8+ chars

# Printing each character of the password
for char in password_base:
    print(char)

# Step 4: Continue asking if the user wants to generate another password
while True:
    again = input("Do you want to generate another password? (yes/no): ").lower()
    if again == "no":
        break
    else:
        # Repeat the password generation process here
        # This could be refactored by placing the above logic in a loop or function for reuse
        name = input("Enter your name: ")
        fav_number = input("Enter your favorite number: ")
        password_base = name[::-1].lower() + fav_number + "!"
        if len(password_base) < 8:
            while len(password_base) < 8:
                password_base += str(int(fav_number) % 9 + 1)
        for char in password_base:
            print(char)
