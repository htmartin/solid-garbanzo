| **Overall Question**         | Clear, concise question that is engaging and well-suited to the dataset.                                                                          | Question is clear and relevant to the dataset.                                                                                        | Question is vague or somewhat relevant to the dataset.                                                                                        | Question is unclear or not well-connected to the dataset.                                                               |
| **Analysis Steps**           | Clearly explains each step in the analysis, showing thoughtful progression from question to insights.                                            | Explains analysis steps with some logical progression; may lack some clarity or detail.                                               | Steps are somewhat unclear or lack logical progression, making it hard to follow the analysis.                                                | Analysis steps are confusing, disorganized, or lack explanation.                                                        |
| **Assumptions**              | States assumptions clearly, explaining their impact on the analysis in a way that is easy to understand.                                          | Lists assumptions made in the analysis, with some explanation of their impact.                                                        | Mentions some assumptions but provides minimal or unclear explanation.                                                                        | Assumptions are missing, unclear, or unexplained.                                                                      |
| **Storytelling and Clarity** | Presentation tells a compelling story with a clear narrative; data insights are connected and logically flow from one point to the next.         | Story and analysis are clear but may lack strong narrative cohesion; insights are mostly connected.                                   | Storytelling is minimal; insights lack strong connections, and the analysis feels somewhat disjointed.                                        | Story is absent or incoherent; insights feel random or poorly connected.                                                |
| **Argument Organization**    | Argument is logically organized, easy to follow, and strengthens the overall presentation.                                                        | Argument is organized, though some areas may lack flow or clarity.                                                                    | Argument is present but lacks clarity or logical flow, making it hard to follow the reasoning.                                                | Argument is confusing, lacks structure, and does not support the analysis well.                                         |
| **Evidence and Data**        | Guides audience effectively through the evidence, with clear explanations of how data supports the question and insights.                         | Includes evidence and attempts to guide the audience, but some points are unclear or underexplained.                                  | Evidence is used, but explanations are brief, making it difficult to understand the connections between data and analysis.                    | Little to no evidence provided, or explanations do not clarify the relationship between data and insights.              |
| **Visualizations**           | High-quality, well-chosen visualizations that effectively communicate key insights and are easy to interpret.                                    | Visualizations are relevant and generally clear, though some may lack polish or full clarity.                                         | Visualizations are present but may be poorly chosen, unclear, or do not fully support the analysis.                                           | Visualizations are missing, unclear, or do not contribute meaningfully to the presentation.                             |
