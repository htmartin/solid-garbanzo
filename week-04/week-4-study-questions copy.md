### Week 4 Learning Objectives

By the end of this lesson, students will be able to:

1. Explain the use and purpose of `for` and `while` loops, including their control mechanisms (`break`, `continue`, and `else`).  
2. Iterate over data structures like strings, lists, and ranges using Python loops.  
3. Apply the `range()` function to generate sequences with varying start, stop, and step values in practical programming scenarios.  
4. Analyze the behavior and efficiency of different loop structures and control statements in solving algorithmic problems.  
5. Design and implement nested loops and algorithmic solutions for real-world problems, optimizing for readability and efficiency.

### Questions to Assess Learning Objectives

#### 1. Explain the use and purpose of `for` and `while` loops, including their control mechanisms.

- Question: What is the difference between a `for` loop and a `while` loop in Python, and when would you use each?  

- Question: What is the purpose of the `break`, `continue`, and `else` statements in loops? 

#### 2. Demonstrate how to iterate over data structures like strings, lists, and ranges.

- Question: Write a `for` loop to print each character in the string `"data"`.  
  

- Question: How would you iterate through the list `[1, 2, 3, 4]` to print each element multiplied by 2?  

#### 3. Apply the `range()` function to generate sequences.

- Question: How would you use the `range()` function to generate the numbers 0, 2, 4, 6, and 8?  

- Question: Write a loop using `range()` to count down from 5 to 0.  

#### 4. Analyze the behavior and efficiency of loop structures.

- Question: Compare the efficiency of a `for` loop using `range()` versus a `while` loop for iterating from 1 to 10.  
  
- Question: Why might using a `break` statement inside a loop improve efficiency?  
  

#### 5. Design and implement nested loops and algorithmic solutions.

- Question: Design an algorithm using loops to check if a number is prime.
