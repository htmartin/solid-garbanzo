#### 1. Question: What is the purpose of using the command line in data science?
Answer:
The command line is a powerful tool in data science that allows for efficient file manipulation, automation of tasks, and control over software environments. It enables data scientists to quickly process large datasets, manage software packages, and execute scripts. Common uses include data preprocessing, environment setup (e.g., using `conda` or `pip`), and interacting with version control systems like Git for managing codebases.

#### 2. Question: What is version control, and why is it important in data science?
Answer:
Version control is a system that records changes to files over time, enabling multiple collaborators to work on a project simultaneously while maintaining a history of modifications. In data science, it is crucial for tracking code development, managing model versions, and ensuring reproducibility. Tools like Git help data scientists revert to previous versions of code, collaborate with others, and manage project dependencies.
Answer:
   Revision control, also known as version control, is crucial in data science for several reasons:
   - Collaboration: It allows multiple data scientists to work on the same codebase without conflicts, by tracking changes and enabling easy merging of different contributions.
   - Tracking Progress: Revision control keeps a detailed history of changes made to the code, allowing you to understand what changes were made, by whom, and why. This is particularly important in data science where model iterations and experiment tracking are common.
   - Reproducibility: By maintaining a history of changes, revision control helps ensure that experiments can be reproduced by using the exact same code and data as before. This is vital for verifying results and ensuring that research is transparent.
   - Error Recovery: If a change introduces a bug or an error, version control systems like Git allow you to revert to previous versions of the codebase, thereby reducing the risk of losing valuable work or introducing irreparable errors.
   - Branching: It enables the creation of branches to test new ideas or features without affecting the main project, facilitating experimentation and innovation.

#### 3. Question: What is a commit in Git, and how does it differ from a push?
Answer:
A commit in Git is a snapshot of your project's file changes that you've saved to your local repository. It is essentially a checkpoint in the project's history, allowing you to document your progress. A push, on the other hand, is the action of sending your local commits to a remote repository (e.g., GitHub). While a commit saves changes locally, a push updates the remote repository with those changes.

#### 4. Question: How can you resolve merge conflicts in Git?
Answer:
Merge conflicts occur when changes in different branches or from different contributors conflict with each other. To resolve a merge conflict, you must manually edit the conflicting files to reconcile the differences. Once resolved, you stage the corrected files using `git add`, then complete the merge with `git commit`. Tools like Gitâ€™s built-in merge tool, or third-party tools like `kdiff3`, can help visualize and resolve conflicts.

#### 5. Question: Explain the difference between `git pull` and `git fetch`.
Answer:
`git fetch` downloads updates from the remote repository but does not merge them with your local changes. It allows you to see what others have contributed without altering your working directory. `git pull` is a combination of `git fetch` followed by `git merge`, meaning it fetches the updates and immediately tries to merge them with your current branch, updating your working directory with the latest changes from the remote repository.

## Command Line and Revision Control Coding/Scripting Data Science Interview Questions 

#### 1. Question: Write a Bash command to find and count the number of `.csv` files in a directory and its subdirectories.
Answer:
```bash
find . -type f -name "*.csv" | wc -l
```
Explanation:
The `find` command searches the current directory (`.`) and its subdirectories for files (`-type f`) with the `.csv` extension. The results are piped (`|`) to `wc -l`, which counts the number of lines, effectively counting the number of `.csv` files found.

#### 2. Question: How would you use Git to check the status of your working directory and see a list of modified files?
Answer:
```bash
git status
```
Explanation:
The `git status` command displays the state of the working directory and the staging area. It shows which files have been modified, which are staged for the next commit, and which files are untracked by Git.

#### 3. Question: Write a Git command to create a new branch and switch to it.
Answer:
```bash
git checkout -b new-branch-name
```
Explanation:
The `git checkout -b` command creates a new branch named `new-branch-name` and switches to it immediately. This is a common practice when starting work on a new feature or experiment to keep changes isolated from the main branch.

#### 4. Question: How can you revert the last commit in Git while keeping the changes in your working directory?
Answer:
```bash
git reset --soft HEAD~1
```
Explanation:
The `git reset --soft HEAD~1` command undoes the last commit but leaves the changes from that commit staged in the working directory. This allows you to modify the changes or recommit them with a different message.

#### 5. Question: Write a Python script that executes a shell command to list all files in a directory and then prints the output.
Answer:
```python
import subprocess

def list_files(directory):
    result = subprocess.run(["ls", "-la", directory], capture_output=True, text=True)
    print(result.stdout)

# Example usage
list_files("/path/to/your/directory")
```
Explanation:
This Python script uses the `subprocess` module to execute the `ls -la` command, which lists all files in the specified directory in long format, including hidden files. The output is captured and printed using `print(result.stdout)`.
