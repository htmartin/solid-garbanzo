Creating a classroom environment that embodies the principles of diversity, equity, inclusion, and belonging (DEIB) requires intentional actions from both students and instructors. List some actions that we both can take:

### Actions for Students

students should create a judgment free space during breakout sessions and all other oppurtinities to interact with peers
students should also take up space while also giving space during class

### Actions for Instructors

instructors should respect and answer all questions as they are all valid, and have a mindset that no stupid questions exist
