### Learning Objectives for the Week:

1. Students will be able to explain the core principles of Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) relating to the use of classes and objects in Python.
2. Students will be able to define and implement Python classes, distinguishing between instance attributes and class attributes.
3. Students will be able to demonstrate encapsulation by using getter and setter methods to control access to class attributes.
4. Students will be able to implement methods in Python classes, understanding the role of `self` and applying it to access instance-specific data.
5. Students will be able differentiate between an instance method and a class method in Python.
6. Students will be able to design and pseudocode their projects at some level prior to coding

### Questions to Assess Learning Objectives:

1. **What is the difference between a class and an object in Python?**
2. **How do instance attributes differ from class attributes in Python? Provide an example.**
3. **Why is `self` used in Python class methods, and how is it different from other method parameters?**
4. **How can you control access to an attribute in Python using encapsulation? Provide an example using getter and setter methods.**
5. **Explain the difference between an instance method and a class method in Python. Provide an example of each.**
