### **Weekly Learning Objectives**

By the end of this week, students will be able to:

1. Define and initialize Python classes using the `class` keyword, understanding the roles of attributes, the `__init__` method, and the `self` parameter.
2. Differentiate between class and instance attributes and implement them in class design for real-world modeling scenarios.
3. Apply encapsulation to manage access to class attributes using private variables, getter and setter methods, and Python's `@property` decorator.
4. Use instance, class, and static methods within Python classes, identifying their appropriate use cases.
5. Build custom Python classes to solve domain-specific problems, integrating principles of object-oriented programming like encapsulation and abstraction.

### Study Questions

#### **1. Defining and Initializing Classes**
- **Question**: Write a Python class `Car` that has attributes `make`, `model`, and `year`. Include an `__init__` method to initialize these attributes. Create an instance of the class for a 2020 Toyota Corolla.  
  

#### **2. Class vs. Instance Attributes**
- **Question**: Explain the difference between class attributes and instance attributes. Provide an example where both are used.  
 

#### **3. Encapsulation and Property Decorators**
- **Question**: Modify the `Car` class to make the `year` attribute private. Add getter and setter methods using the `@property` decorator to manage access.  
  
#### **4. Method Types**
- **Question**: Write a Python class `MathOperations` with three methods: an instance method `add` that adds two numbers, a class method `description` that returns a string description, and a static method `square` that returns the square of a number.  
 

#### **5. Building Custom Classes**
- **Question**: Design a `Student` class to model a university student. Include attributes for `name` and `grades` (a list of grades), and a method `average_grade` to calculate the average grade.
