### Weekly Learning Objectives:

By the end of this lesson, students will be able to:

1. Create and customize static visualizations using `matplotlib`, including adjusting figure properties, axes, and subplots to effectively present data.  
2. Use `seaborn` to create and interpret statistical plots, such as regression lines, bar plots, and heatmaps, to uncover and display relationships within data.  
3. Evaluate and implement principles of effective data visualization to create "data-ink-rich" graphics while avoiding misleading elements.  
4. Integrate visualizations into analytical narratives to support data-driven conclusions effectively.  
5. Compare the capabilities of different Python visualization libraries (e.g., `matplotlib`, `seaborn`, `plotly`, `Bokeh`) and choose appropriate tools for static and interactive visualizations.

### Questions to Assess Learning Objectives

#### **Objective 1: Static Visualizations with `matplotlib`**  
**Question:**  
How would you create a figure with two subplots arranged horizontally, where the first subplot shows a bar chart and the second a scatter plot? Customize the figure to include grid lines in both subplots.

#### **Objective 2: Statistical Plots with `seaborn`**  
**Question:**  
Using `seaborn`, how would you create a heatmap to visualize the correlation matrix of a dataset? Add annotations to display the correlation values.



#### **Objective 3: Principles of Effective Visualization**  
**Question:**  
What are three principles of effective data visualization according to Edward Tufte, and how would you apply them in a Python plot?



#### **Objective 4: Integrating Visualizations with Analysis**  
**Question:**  
When integrating visualizations into a data analysis report, what are three practices to ensure they effectively support your analytical narrative?


#### **Objective 5: Comparing Visualization Libraries**  
**Question:**  
What are the primary differences between `matplotlib`, `seaborn`, and `plotly`, and when would you use each?
