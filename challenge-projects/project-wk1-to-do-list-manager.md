### **Version-Controlled To-Do List Manager**

#### **Overview:**
You are required to develop a basic command-line interface (CLI) application for managing a to-do list. The application will allow users to add, view, complete, and remove tasks from their list, all from the command line. Additionally, you will use Git to version control the to-do list, tracking changes made to the list over time. 

#### **Requirements:**

1. **Command-Line Interface (CLI) Operations:**
   - The application must be operated entirely through the command line.
   - The CLI should support the following operations:
     - Adding new tasks to the to-do list.
     - Viewing all tasks with their current status.
     - Marking tasks as completed.
     - Removing tasks from the list.

2. **File Management:**
   - Tasks must be stored in a text file (`todo.txt`), with each task including its status (e.g., `[ ]` for incomplete, `[X]` for completed).
   - The application should be able to read from and write to this file, ensuring that tasks are persistently stored.

3. **Version Control with Git:**
   - You must initialize a Git repository for the project to track changes to the `todo.txt` file.
   - Each significant operation (adding, completing, removing tasks) should be committed to the repository with an appropriate commit message.
   - You should be able to use Git to review the history of changes to the to-do list, understanding how the list has evolved over time.

4. **Error Handling:**
   - The application must handle common errors gracefully, such as invalid task numbers or missing commands.

#### **Objectives:**

- To practice building a simple CLI application that interacts with the file system.
- To learn and apply basic Git commands for version control, including initializing a repository, staging changes, committing, and viewing commit history.
- To gain experience in managing files and persisting data using Python.
- To understand the importance of version control in tracking changes and managing the development process.
