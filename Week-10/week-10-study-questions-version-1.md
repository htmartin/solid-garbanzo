### **Weekly Learning Objectives**

By the end of this week, students will be able to:

1. Create and manipulate pandas Series and DataFrames to represent and analyze tabular data efficiently.
2. Apply operations such as indexing, filtering, and sorting to extract and transform data within pandas structures.
3. Use pandas methods, such as `apply`, `agg`, and `applymap`, to compute statistics and apply custom functions across Series and DataFrames.
4. Perform arithmetic operations and handle missing data in pandas, leveraging automatic alignment and broadcasting features.
5. Generate visualizations directly from pandas DataFrames and save data to and load data from files (e.g., CSV) for data persistence and sharing.

### Study Questions 

#### **1. Creating and Manipulating pandas Series and DataFrames**
- **Question**: Write Python code to create a pandas DataFrame with columns "Name", "Age", and "Score". Add a new column "Passed" that indicates whether the "Score" is greater than or equal to 50.  

#### **2. Indexing, Filtering, and Sorting**
- **Question**: How can you select rows in a DataFrame where the "Age" column is greater than 28? Sort the resulting DataFrame by "Score" in descending order.  

#### **3. Applying Functions**
- **Question**: Use `apply` to compute a "Category" column in the DataFrame based on the "Score" column. Scores ≥ 70 should be labeled "High", scores ≥ 50 as "Medium", and others as "Low".  

#### **4. Handling Missing Data and Arithmetic Operations**
- **Question**: Write Python code to create a DataFrame with missing values. Fill missing values in the "Score" column with the mean of the column.  

#### **5. Visualizing and Saving Data**
- **Question**: Plot a histogram of the "Score" column and save the DataFrame to a CSV file.
