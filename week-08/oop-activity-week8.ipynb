    "- For this activity, you won't be writing any actual code. \n",
    "- Instead, your task is to create solution designs for 2 of the problems below.\n",
    "- Develop a solution design for each that utilizes the OOP principles of polymorphism, inheritance, and encapsulation.\n",
    "- You can use the example below as a model for your design documents\n",
    "- In your design documents: \n",
    "   1. Specify the major classes, attributes and methods you will use.\n",
    "   2. Explain how you are applying the OOP principles in your solutions. \n",
    "- Be prepared to present your solutions to the group. "

    "### Payment Processing System\n",
    "\n",
    "- Problem: Create a payment processing system that supports multiple payment methods such as credit cards, PayPal, and bank transfers.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Classes:\n",
    " \n",
    " `PaymentMethod` (Base class)\n",
    "  - **Attributes**: `amount`\n",
    "  - **Methods**: `process_payment()`\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "`CreditCard` (inherits from `PaymentMethod`)\n",
    "  - **Attributes**: `card_number`, `expiration_date`, `cvv`\n",
    "  - **Methods**: `process_payment()`\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "`PayPal` (inherits from `PaymentMethod`)\n",
    "  - **Attributes**: `email_address`, `password`\n",
    "  - **Methods**: `process_payment()`\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "`BankTransfer` (inherits from `PaymentMethod`)\n",
    "  - **Attributes**: `account_number`, `routing_number`\n",
    "  - **Methods**: `process_payment()`\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "`Transaction`\n",
    "  - **Attributes**: `transaction_id`, `payment_method`, `status`\n",
    "  - **Methods**: `initiate_payment()`, `refund()`\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "#### OOP Principles:\n",
    "\n",
    "**Polymorphism**: The `process_payment()` method is defined differently in each subclass (`CreditCard`, `PayPal`, `BankTransfer`), but all are called in the same way by the `Transaction` class.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Inheritance**: `PaymentMethod` is a base class for different payment types, sharing the `amount` attribute and `process_payment()` method signature.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Encapsulation**: Sensitive details like card numbers or PayPal passwords are stored privately within their respective classes, only accessed through secure methods like `process_payment()`."
