### Study Questions

1. What is the difference between inheritance and composition in object-oriented design? Provide an example of when you would use one over the other.

2. How does polymorphism contribute to code flexibility in Python? Provide an example.

3. What is method overriding, and why is it useful in using subclasses? Provide an example.

4. What is duck typing, and how does it differ from traditional polymorphism in Python?

5. Explain the purpose of magic methods in Python. Provide an example of how you would use `__eq__` and `__repr__` in a class.

6. What are the benefits of using dataclasses in Python? Provide a simple example.

7. What is the significance of properties in Python? How do they contribute to encapsulation?

### Learning Objectives Week 8

1. Students will be able to design and implement Python classes that use object-oriented principles such as inheritance, encapsulation, and polymorphism.
2. Students will be able to apply and understand the concept of method overriding and how it is used in child classes to extend or modify behavior of parent classes.
3. Students will be able to explain and implement polymorphism to make their code more modular and flexible.
4. Students will be able to utilize magic methods to customize object behavior, such as overloading operators and defining custom string representations.
5. Students will be able to differentiate between inheritance, composition, and aggregation, and apply them appropriately in Python class design.
6. Students will be able to use dataclasses and named tuples to efficiently handle simple data structures in Python.
7. Students will be able to demonstrate the use of properties to contribute to encapsulation.
