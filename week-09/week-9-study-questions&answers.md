### Study Questions :

1. **What are the main components of the PyData ecosystem, and how do they contribute to data science workflows?**
   - **Answer:** The main components are Jupyter Notebooks (for interactive coding and documentation), NumPy (for efficient numerical operations on arrays and matrices), pandas (for data manipulation and analysis of tabular data), and Matplotlib (for data visualization). These tools form the foundation of Python-based data science workflows, allowing users to analyze, visualize, and manipulate data efficiently.

2. **Why is NumPy preferred over Python lists for numerical computations in data science?**
   - **Answer:** NumPy arrays are more memory efficient because they store data contiguously in memory, allowing for faster access and operations compared to Python lists. NumPy also supports vectorized operations, which are much faster than looping through Python lists, particularly for large datasets, due to the use of optimized C-based code.

3. **What is vectorization in NumPy, and how does it improve code performance?**
   - **Answer:** Vectorization refers to the ability to apply operations to entire arrays at once, without using explicit loops. This improves performance by leveraging low-level optimizations in NumPy, allowing for faster execution and more concise code. For example, adding 1 to all elements in a NumPy array can be done with `array + 1` instead of looping through each element.

4. **How would you reshape a one-dimensional array of 9 elements into a 3x3 matrix using NumPy?**
   - **Answer:** You can use the `reshape()` method in NumPy. If `array` is a one-dimensional array with 9 elements, `array.reshape(3, 3)` would transform it into a 3x3 matrix.

5. **How do you perform matrix multiplication in NumPy?**
   - **Answer:** Matrix multiplication in NumPy can be performed using the `dot()` function. For two matrices `A` and `B`, matrix multiplication is done using `np.dot(A, B)`. Alternatively, you can use the `@` operator, such as `A @ B`, for matrix multiplication in NumPy.

6. **Give an example of Boolean indexing in NumPy. How does it work, and when would you use it?**
   - **Answer:** Boolean indexing allows you to filter an array based on conditions. For example, given an array `arr = np.array([1, 2, 3, 4, 5])`, if you want to select all elements greater than 3, you would use `arr[arr > 3]`, which would return `array([4, 5])`. This is useful for selecting elements that meet certain conditions without writing loops.

7. **What is fancy indexing, and how can you use it to reorder elements in a NumPy array?**
   - **Answer:** Fancy indexing refers to selecting elements from an array using arrays of indices. For example, given `arr = np.array([10, 20, 30, 40, 50])`, you can reorder elements by specifying the desired order of indices: `arr[[4, 3, 1]]` would return `array([50, 40, 20])`. It is a flexible way to reorder or select multiple elements at once.
