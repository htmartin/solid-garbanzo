### Weekly Learning Objectives:

- By the end of this lesson, students will be able to load and inspect a dataset using Python's Pandas library to assess initial data integrity.
- By the end of this lesson, students will be able to identify and address common data issues, such as duplicates, incorrect data types, and inconsistent formatting.
- By the end of this lesson, students will be able to standardize and transform categorical and binary data for analytical use.
- By the end of this lesson, students will be able to document assumptions, cleaning steps, and transformations during the data preparation process.
- By the end of this lesson, students will be able to analyze and answer specific questions using a cleaned dataset, applying EDA techniques to derive insights.

1. Question: How would you load a dataset in Python and view its initial structure?  
2. Question: Describe a common data inconsistency you might encounter with categorical variables and how to handle it.  
3. Question: When preparing data, why is it essential to document each transformation step? 
4. Question: What graphical techniques might you use in EDA to detect data patterns or outliers?  
5. Question: How would you approach answering the question, "Which operator had the most spills?"
