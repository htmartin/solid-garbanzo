### Async presentation Instructions:

- Don’t try to recap everything
- Looking for 5 min presentation (10 max)
- Choose **3-5** Big Ideas of the material- really, don't try to do more than 5 :-) !!!

#### What's a Big Idea?
- Provides a focusing conceptual “lens” for any study
- Connects and organize many facts, skills, and experiences
- Points to ideas at the heart of expert understanding of the subject
- For example:
#### Week 1 Big Ideas
- The command line interface (CLI) offers a more direct and scriptable way to control and automate tasks compared to graphical user interfaces (GUIs) which rely on visual navigation and mouse clicks by allowing users to interact with the computer through text commands.
- Revision control (e.g. Git) enables tracking and managing changes to code or files over time in a distributed manner.
- Programming languages, like recipes and knitting patterns are tools used to create and express algorithms. They have sequential steps and the properties of clarity and precision, reproducibility, and modularity.
- Computer architecture layers (hardware at the bottom, the operating system in the middle, and applications on top) simplify user interaction with the computer by providing standardized abstractions at each level.

#### Expansion

Yours would be more of a presentation with explanation, I just want to give some example of what a big idea is
The expansion you would include should deepen the understanding without diving too far into the weeds, e.g., …
- Computer architecture layers simplify user interaction with the computer by providing standardized abstractions at each level.
- 1. Hardware Abstraction: The operating system provides a simplified and consistent interface to interact with various hardware components (e.g., CPU, memory, storage) without needing to know the specifics of the hardware.
- 2. File System Abstraction: The operating system abstracts the underlying data storage into files and directories, allowing users to organize and manage data in a standardized way regardless of the actual storage medium.
- 3. Process Abstraction: The operating system manages the execution of programs, allowing multiple applications to run simultaneously without interfering with each other.
- 4. User Abstraction: The operating system defines different types of users (regular users, system users, superusers) and manages permissions and access controls, ensuring secure and controlled access to system resources.
- 5. Network Abstraction: The operating system provides a consistent way to interact with network resources, abstracting the complexities of underlying network protocols and hardware.
