### **Weekly Learning Objectives**

By the end of this week, students will be able to:

1. Evaluate algorithm efficiency using asymptotic analysis, applying Big-O and Big-Theta notation to classify algorithms based on growth rates.
2. Implement algorithms for linear and bisection search in Python, analyzing their time complexities and justifying their use cases.
3. Measure the execution time of Python functions using modules like `time` and `timeit` and explain the influence of dataset size on runtime performance.
4. Apply recursive and iterative techniques to solve computational problems, including efficient implementations like Kadane’s algorithm.
5. Demonstrate proficiency with Python’s module and package system to structure code and use external libraries for data processing tasks.

### **Study Questions**

#### **1. Evaluating Algorithm Efficiency**
- **Question**: Explain the difference between Big-O and Big-Theta notation. Provide an example of when to use each.  


#### **2. Linear and Bisection Search**
- **Question**: Write Python code for a bisection search algorithm to find an element in a sorted list. What is its time complexity?  
  
  
#### **3. Measuring Execution Time**
- **Question**: How can you measure the execution time of a function in Python? Demonstrate with an example.  


#### **4. Recursive and Iterative Techniques**
- **Question**: Implement Kadane’s algorithm to find the maximum subarray sum in a list. Explain why it is more efficient than a naive approach.  
  

#### **5. Python Modules and Packages**
- **Question**: What is the difference between a Python module and a package? How would you create a package for your project?
