### Example Answers

### Short Answers:

1. **Importance of Execution Time:**
   - Considering execution time is crucial with large datasets because inefficient algorithms can lead to significant delays, wasting time and resources.
   - An example is a sorting algorithm with quadratic time complexity (O(n²)) becoming impractical when sorting millions of items.

2. **Manual Measurement with `time.time()`:**
   - The main limitation of `time.time()` is its coarse resolution, which may lead to inaccurate measurements for short-running algorithms or small differences between algorithms.
   - It can be useful when measuring overall runtime, but it falls short for precise benchmarking or fine-grained performance comparisons.

3. **Growth Rate Matters More:**
   - The growth rate, reflected by how an algorithm scales as the input size increases, is more informative than a single measurement because it predicts performance for larger inputs.
   - Understanding growth rate helps in selecting scalable algorithms that remain efficient as dataset size increases.

4. **Big O Notation:**
   - Big O notation describes the upper bound of an algorithm's growth rate, helping to compare and understand worst-case performance.
   - For example, if one algorithm is O(n) and another is O(n²), Big O would guide you to choose O(n) for large datasets due to its better scaling.

5. **Example of Exponential Growth:**
   - If an algorithm exhibits exponential growth (e.g., O(2ⁿ)), the execution time doubles with each additional input, making it extremely slow as the input size grows.
   - Exponential algorithms are impractical for large datasets because even small increases in input size lead to prohibitively long runtimes.
